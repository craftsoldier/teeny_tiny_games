      "Three months later, you're living together in a cozy apartment with mismatched furniture and big dreams. Alex got offered a promotion at their company, but there's a catch - they have to choose between two cities. New York means a corner office, a six-figure salary, and rubbing elbows with executives. It also means long hours, constant pressure, and Alex's charming ex, Jordan, who just happens to work at the New York branch.",
      "Paris, on the other hand, is romantic. Intimate. A smaller role, but more work-life balance. You've always talked about living abroad together, sipping wine on balconies, getting lost in cobblestone streets. But Paris also means Alex's childhood friend Riley will be their direct supervisor - and you've seen the old photos. Riley had feelings for Alex once. Maybe they still do.",
      "Tonight, over takeout containers and nervous laughter, Alex turns to you with those eyes you fell for and says, 'I need you to help me decide. Where should we go? What kind of life do you want us to build together?'"

Through the window, the Manhattan skyline glitters like a promise.",
