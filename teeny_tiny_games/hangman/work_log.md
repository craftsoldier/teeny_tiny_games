  - Fixed `range(len(word))` âœ…
- Completed `display_word()` function âœ…
- Built `check_win()` function with None handling âœ…
- Implemented game loop with:
  - 6 wrong guesses limit âœ…
  - Correct/incorrect guess logic âœ…
  - Win condition checking âœ…
- **Status:** Near completion
- **Duration:** ~10 minutes

---

### [3:30pm - 3:55pm] Final Polish & Bug Fixes
- Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` to run game âœ…
- Fixed display formatting (added newline) âœ…
- Added case-insensitivity with `.lower()` âœ…
- Added single character validation `len(guess) == 1` âœ…
- Added wrong guess counter feedback âœ…
- Added "YOU LOST" message âœ…
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Duration:** ~25 minutes

---

## FINAL STATE (3:55pm) âœ…
- **Deadline:** 4:00pm
- **Completion Time:** 3:55pm
- **TIME SAVED:** 5 minutes early! ðŸ”¥
- **Total Code:** 55 lines
- **Functions Built:** 4 (word_generator, display_word, check_win, main)
- **Game Status:** âœ… FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### Features Implemented:
âœ… Random word selection
âœ… Hidden word display with underscores
âœ… Letter guessing with validation
âœ… Case-insensitive input
âœ… Single character validation
âœ… Win/loss detection
âœ… 6 wrong guess limit
âœ… Guess counter feedback
âœ… Win/loss messages

### Known Limitations (acceptable for v1.0):
- No tracking of previously guessed letters (repeat guesses penalized)
- Small word list (3 words)

## PROJECT COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰
