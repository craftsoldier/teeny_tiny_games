# Atomic Clock with Curses UI - Project Todo

## Phase 1: NTP Time Synchronization (Learning & Prototyping)

- [ ] Research NTP protocol basics
  - Understand what NTP servers are and how they provide atomic time
  - Learn about NTP response structure (time, offset, delay, precision)

- [ ] Install required library
  - Install `ntplib` package: `pip install ntplib`

- [ ] Create basic NTP client script
  - Write a simple Python script to query an NTP server (e.g., pool.ntp.org)
  - Print the returned time data
  - Print the offset between your system time and NTP time
  - Print the round-trip delay

- [ ] Test with multiple NTP servers
  - Try different servers (pool.ntp.org, time.google.com, time.nist.gov)
  - Handle connection errors gracefully
  - Understand which values you need to display

## Phase 2: Basic Curses Display

- [ ] Learn curses fundamentals
  - Read Python curses documentation
  - Understand `initscr()`, `refresh()`, `addstr()`, `getch()`

- [ ] Create "Hello World" curses app
  - Initialize curses screen
  - Display static text
  - Properly cleanup with try/finally block

- [ ] Build simple updating clock display
  - Show current local time
  - Update display every second
  - Make it exit gracefully (e.g., press 'q' to quit)

- [ ] Experiment with curses features
  - Try different cursor positions
  - Test color pairs (if you want colors)
  - Learn about `nodelay()` for non-blocking input

## Phase 3: Integration

- [ ] Design your data flow
  - Decide how to store the latest NTP time
  - Plan how sync module will communicate with display module

- [ ] Implement threading
  - Create a background thread for periodic NTP syncing
  - Use thread-safe data structures (like threading.Lock)
  - Keep UI responsive during network calls

- [ ] Combine NTP data with curses display
  - Display the atomically accurate time (not just local time)
  - Show when time was last synced
  - Calculate and display continuously updating time based on last sync

## Phase 4: Status Indicators & Precision Metrics

- [ ] Add sync status display
  - Show "Last synced: X seconds ago"
  - Display connection status (Connected/Syncing/Error)
  - Show which NTP server is being used

- [ ] Display precision metrics
  - Show time with milliseconds
  - Display network latency/delay
  - Show offset from local system time
  - Display precision value from NTP response

- [ ] Improve error handling
  - Handle network timeouts
  - Handle DNS resolution failures
  - Show meaningful error messages in UI
  - Retry logic for failed syncs

## Phase 5: Polish & Enhancement

- [ ] Improve UI layout
  - Design a clean, organized layout
  - Add borders or sections
  - Use colors to highlight important information

- [ ] Add configuration options
  - Make sync interval configurable
  - Allow choosing different NTP servers
  - Make display format customizable

- [ ] Code organization
  - Split code into modules (ntp_client.py, display.py, main.py)
  - Add docstrings and comments
  - Follow Python best practices

- [ ] Testing & refinement
  - Test on different terminal sizes
  - Test network failure scenarios
  - Test for extended periods to check for time drift
  - Add logging for debugging

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- [ ] Add ability to manually trigger sync (press 's' key)
- [ ] Display multiple time zones
- [ ] Create a configuration file for settings
- [ ] Add command-line arguments for options
- [ ] Show a visual graph of time offset over time
- [ ] Add sound/visual alert if sync fails

## Learning Resources to Explore

- Python `curses` documentation
- Python `ntplib` documentation
- NTP protocol overview (RFC 5905)
- Python threading/asyncio tutorials
- Terminal UI design patterns

## Notes

- Start simple and iterate - don't try to build everything at once
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next
- Keep backups of working versions as you progress
- Don't hesitate to refactor as you learn better approaches
